This roll source supports building with multiple compilers.  By default, it
builds using only the gnu compilers.  To build for a different compiler set,
use the ROLLCOMPILER make variable, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER="intel gnu"

The build process currently supports any combination of the values "pgi",
"intel" and "gnu" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".

If the ROLLCOMPILER variable is specified, its value(s) are incorporated into
the names of the produced rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER="intel gnu"

produces a roll that contains and installs rpms with names that begin
hdf4-intel, hdf4-gnu, etc.
