The dataform Roll provides libraries for the netcdf data
format along with the nco toolkit for netcdf on a Rocks cluster.  The packaged
software is installed in /opt/netcdf on both server
and client nodes.  If the intel and/or pgi compiler rolls are present,
libraries built with those compilers are installed alongside the standard
libraries built with the gnu compilers.
